# this is the source file we're creating. It specifies the "place" where to look for the source data
# (be it BQ/Snowflake/...)
version: 2
# why do models and source yml models always start with `version: 2`? https://docs.getdbt.com/faqs/project/why-version-2

# name - key
# the object type is a list, each list element written with the - bullet tick
sources:

  # name of the dataset I'm using
  - name: thelook_ecommerce
    # attributes of the object! not list elements, but just properties
    # database <> project are interchangable in dbt-bigquery. but project is a BQ-specific name,
    # whereas database is more general (e.g.)
    database: bigquery-public-data
    # copied all the table names from the BQ dataset
    tables:
      #- name: distribution_centers
      #- name: events
      - name: inventory_items
      - name: order_items
      - name: orders
      - name: products
      - name: users
